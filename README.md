# MVC_tech_blog

Description

For this challenge we are building a blog site that specializes in technology and allows users to upload content and make comments/suggestions on other users' content.  As developers tend to search out new and interesting ideas and concepts to improve their prowess in the field, this challenge made perfect sense.  It is however a work in progress like most of my submissions. I was once again helped by my instructor Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor Erik Hoversten.  

Usage

When finished, the user should clone this repository, and run the following commands after navigating to the project folder. 
npm run test
npm run seed
npm start server
